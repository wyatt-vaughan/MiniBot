EnhancedConflictPlanner: collision-safe parallel-wave iterative planner with
active deadlock resolution.

When both sea-parting and single-blocker detour fail on the same iteration,
a "make way" cycle is triggered:

  1. The stuck piece *furthest from its goal* is selected as the priority
     piece for this cycle.
  2. Every other piece whose current position falls within _CLEARANCE of
     the priority piece's direct path is given a "park" position outside
     that corridor.  Multiple blocking pieces are moved in parallel per
     clearing round.  Cascades (blocker A can't park because blocker B is
     in the way) are resolved iteratively across MAKE_WAY_PARK_ROUNDS rounds.
  3. Once the corridor is clear, the priority piece is sent directly to its
     goal in a single wave.
  4. The main iterative planner resumes from the new positions.

If a new deadlock occurs after a make-way cycle, steps 1-4 repeat until
MAKE_WAY_MAX_CYCLES interventions have been exhausted.

Clean-room redesign with collision safety as the foundational invariant.

Priority order (highest first):
  1. Collision safety  - every emitted move passes a swept-capsule check against
                         ALL other pieces before it is accepted.  No exceptions.
  2. Target completion - iterative replanning + detour waves keep going until
                         every piece reaches its goal (or the iteration cap hits).
  3. Parallel motion   - pieces whose moves are mutually safe share a wave
                         (same sequence_num) so the bots move simultaneously.
  4. Move chaining     - after planning, consecutive single-piece collinear waves
                         are merged into one command to simplify communication.

Algorithm overview
------------------
Each outer iteration tries to build one "wave" (a set of parallel moves):

  _build_wave()
    - Processes pieces in decreasing remaining-distance order (furthest first).
    - For each candidate piece:
        1. Try the direct path to goal at scales 1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25.
        2. If all direct scales are blocked, try bypass waypoints offset
           perpendicularly from the nearest blocker (both sides x 3 distances).
    - For pieces already committed to THIS wave, their endpoint (not starting
      position) is used as their effective position.  This correctly models
      simultaneous motion: two pieces moving at the same time cannot end up
      within clearance of each other.
    - _safe() is THE single collision gate, checked against:
        a) swept capsule vs. all static piece positions
        b) endpoint   vs. all static piece positions
        c) swept capsule vs. all committed wave segments
        d) endpoint   vs. all committed wave endpoints

  When no piece can make forward progress:
    _find_detour()
      - Counts how many stuck pieces each other piece is blocking.
      - Moves the highest-vote blocker to the nearest safe escape position
        (8 compass directions x 3 clearance multiples).

  After all waves are built, _chain_merge() fuses consecutive waves that
  contain only one piece and whose segments are collinear (<=30 deg turn).

        Multi-wave corridor clearing for the "walled-in back-rank" deadlock.

        Returns a list of waves (each wave is a List[_Move]) that, when
        executed in order, clear the direct path for the most-stuck remaining
        piece.  Returns None if no clearing plan can be made.

        Why multiple waves?
        -------------------
        The old single-wave approach required EVERY corridor blocker to find an
        escape simultaneously.  When blockers are packed tightly (e.g. 8 pawns
        on a rank) each one's escape is blocked by its neighbours, so the
        `all_moved` gate would fail and the algorithm gave up, leaving the
        stuck piece to oscillate via the single-blocker detour.

        This version uses a simulated position snapshot (`sim_pos`) to plan
        up to _MAX_SEA_ROUNDS clearing waves in advance:

          Round 1  Outermost blockers (farthest from stuck piece, most free
                   space) are moved first.  Partial progress is fine � pieces
                   that can't escape yet are skipped without aborting the wave.
          Round 2  With round-1 pieces out of the way, middle blockers now
                   have room and can be moved.
          ...      Continues until the corridor is fully clear or no further
                   progress is possible.

        All planned waves are returned at once so the caller can emit them
        back-to-back.  This prevents the main loop from returning displaced
        pieces to their goals (re-blocking the corridor) between clearing waves.

        Trigger condition: at least one corridor blocker is settled (within
        2 � _DOCK of its own goal).  Purely un-settled blockers are handled
        better by the normal _build_wave / _find_detour flow.
